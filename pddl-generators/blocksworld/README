The blocksworld generators use the random bw state generator provided
by John Slaney and Sylvie Thiebaux. This is contained in the bwstates.1
subdirectory. The directories 3ops/2pddl and 4ops/2pddl contain
programs that translate the generator's output to PDDL. The random
instances can then be generated by running the script

./blocksworld <ops> <num>

which takes as input the number of operators (either 3 or 4) and blocks
in the problem to be generated. This is currently maximal 200 due to
the random state generator. To increase that, edit the Makefile in
bwstates.1 and increase SIZE.
