# if the number of visits is made smaller, it becomes less likely that
# a schedule exists. With sufficiently few visits by the airplanes to
# the chosen airports, almost certainly no schedules exist. Also, with 
# far more planes than 3*days no maintenance visits can be scheduled
# for some of the planes, turning the problem not solvable.
# Increasing the number of planes past 3*days and simultaneously increasing
# the number of visits keeps the problem solvable and probably also
# challenging, but we have not investigated the impact of different
# parameter combinations on the difficulty of the problem.
